# Workout Components Refactor - Prompt Plan

## Overview
Refactoring workout-related components into a unified, reusable system using the established Norse neumorphic design system. This multi-phase approach ensures consistent styling, improved maintainability, and better user experience across all workout contexts.

## Phase Structure

### **Phase 1: WorkoutCard Component** üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
**Status**: Ready  
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes  
**Priority**: High - Foundation component needed for other phases

**Scope**:
- Create unified WorkoutCard component with multiple layout variants
- Replace existing inconsistent workout card implementations
- Add programmatic duration calculation
- Integrate click-to-summary functionality
- Update styleguide patterns page

**Files Affected**:
- `components/ui/workout-card.tsx` (new)
- `src/app/styleguide/patterns/page.tsx` (update)
- Various files using existing workout cards (search & replace)

**Key Features**:
- Props-based variants (compact/full layouts)
- Smart exercise preview truncation
- Last completed date formatting
- Consistent stats grid with neumorphic icons
- Integration hooks for summary modal

---

### **Phase 2: WorkoutSummaryModal Component** üìä  
**Status**: Pending Phase 1  
**Estimated Time**: 20-30 minutes  
**Priority**: High - Needed for Phase 1 integration

**Scope**:
- Create detailed workout summary modal
- Integrate with existing MuscleHighlighter component
- Add comprehensive stats display
- Exercise list with sets/reps/weights
- Mobile-optimized scrollable design

**Files Affected**:
- `components/ui/workout-summary-modal.tsx` (new)
- Update WorkoutCard to integrate modal
- Styleguide documentation updates

**Key Features**:
- Full workout statistics grid
- Exercise breakdown with muscle groups
- Muscle activation visualization
- Responsive layout (desktop/mobile)
- Smooth open/close animations

---

### **Phase 3: Success Surface Variant** ‚úÖ
**Status**: Pending - Need to verify existence  
**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Priority**: Medium - Needed for workout group completion states

**Scope**:
- Verify if success surface variant exists in design tokens
- If not, create success surface variant using forest colors at 50% opacity
- Implement concave gradient depth for completed states
- Update design system documentation

**Files Affected**:
- Design token files (CSS custom properties)
- Component variant systems
- Styleguide documentation

---

### **Phase 4A: WorkoutGroup Component (Logging)** üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
**Status**: Ready to implement  
**Estimated Time**: 90-120 minutes  
**Priority**: High - Core workout logging functionality

**Scope**:
- Create unified WorkoutGroup component with Single/Superset/Circuit variants
- Integrate proper Input, Checkbox, Select components from design system
- Implement success surface highlighting for completed sets
- Clean up duplicate custom components
- Apply Norse neumorphic styling and design tokens
- Maintain existing functionality while improving reusability

**Files Affected**:
- `components/ui/workout-group.tsx` (new unified component)
- Various workout logging pages using existing group components
- Remove duplicate/custom input components
- Styleguide patterns page updates

**Key Features**:
- Props-based variants (single/superset/circuit)
- Completion state highlighting with success surface
- Unified input components (no custom duplicates)
- "Add Set" dashed button pattern
- RPE and timing integration
- Norse neumorphic styling throughout

---

### **Phase 4B: WorkoutGroup Component (Planning)** üìã
**Status**: Future phase after 4A completion  
**Estimated Time**: 60-90 minutes  
**Priority**: Medium - Planning interface improvement

**Scope**:
- Extend WorkoutGroup component for planning context
- Same Single/Superset/Circuit variants but for exercise selection
- Consistent styling with logging variant
- Exercise addition/removal workflows

**Dependencies**: Phase 4A must be completed first

---

## Design System Dependencies

### **Required Design Tokens**:
- `--surface-success` (forest colors, 50% opacity, concave)
- Existing Norse neumorphic tokens (confirmed working)
- Button variant tokens for dashed borders

### **Component Dependencies**:
- Existing Card component with depth/surface/border props
- Existing Button component variants
- MuscleHighlighter component (for summary modal)
- Existing form components (for workout groups)

### **Styling Consistency**:
- All components use established Norse color palette
- Consistent neumorphic shadow/surface treatments
- Unified typography and spacing scales
- Mobile-first responsive patterns

## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase Execution Order**:
1. **WorkoutCard** ‚Üí Foundation component, needed by others
2. **WorkoutSummaryModal** ‚Üí Required for WorkoutCard integration
3. **Success Surface** ‚Üí Design token needed for workout groups
4. **WorkoutGroup Components** ‚Üí Most complex, depends on all previous

### **Testing Checkpoints**:
- After Phase 1: Verify workout cards display correctly across app
- After Phase 2: Test modal integration and muscle map display
- After Phase 3: Confirm success highlighting works
- After Phase 4: Full workout logging/planning flow testing

### **Rollback Points**:
- Each phase is self-contained with clear file boundaries
- Original components preserved until testing confirms new versions
- Styleguide documentation tracks all changes

## Success Criteria

### **Technical Goals**:
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for workout display components
- ‚úÖ Consistent Norse neumorphic styling across all variants
- ‚úÖ Improved component reusability and maintainability
- ‚úÖ Enhanced mobile responsiveness
- ‚úÖ Type-safe props and component interfaces

### **User Experience Goals**:
- ‚úÖ Faster workout browsing with consistent layouts
- ‚úÖ Better information hierarchy and readability
- ‚úÖ Seamless workout summary access
- ‚úÖ Intuitive workout logging with visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Consistent interaction patterns across contexts

### **Developer Experience Goals**:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive styleguide documentation with live examples
- ‚úÖ Clear component APIs with TypeScript support
- ‚úÖ Reduced code duplication and maintenance burden
- ‚úÖ Easy-to-extend component system for future features

## Risk Mitigation

### **Potential Issues**:
- **Scope creep**: Stick to defined component boundaries
- **Design inconsistencies**: Reference styleguide frequently
- **Integration complexity**: Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
- **Performance impact**: Monitor component rendering efficiency

### **Mitigation Strategies**:
- Phase-by-phase implementation with clear checkpoints
- Maintain existing components until new versions are confirmed working
- Regular testing against multiple workout data scenarios
- Keep design token usage consistent with established patterns

## Future Roadmap (Beyond This Refactor)

### **Exercise Library Evolution**:
- **Local JSON Database**: Curated exercise collection to replace WGER dependency
- **Rich Exercise Schema**: Equipment categories, variants, movement patterns, difficulty levels
- **Equipment Profiles**: User equipment inventory (home gym ‚Üí commercial gym ‚Üí strongman/metcon)
- **Smart Filtering**: Auto-suggest alternatives based on available equipment

### **Data Architecture Goals**:
- **WGER Usage**: Planning phase only (search/select exercises)
- **Self-Contained Workouts**: Complete exercise data embedded, no API dependencies during workouts
- **Equipment Categories**: Barbell, Dumbbell, Kettlebell, Strongman, Metcon, Bodyweight, etc.
- **Exercise Relationships**: Variants, similar exercises, progression paths

*Note: These features are planned for future development and should not influence the current 4-phase component refactor.*

## Next Steps
1. Execute Phase 1 (WorkoutCard) prompt
2. Test and validate implementation
3. Proceed to Phase 2 (WorkoutSummaryModal) if Phase 1 successful
4. Continue through remaining phases in order
