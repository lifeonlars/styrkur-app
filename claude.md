# Styrkur Saga - Norse Fitness Tracker

## Project Essence

Mobile-first PWA fitness tracker with Norse mythology theme and Tesla Cybertruck-inspired neumorphic design. Next.js + TypeScript + CSS Modules + BEM architecture.

## Current Focus

ðŸ”„ **NEXT**: Continue feature development and PWA enhancements

- âœ… Neumorphic design system with depth/surface/border utilities
- âœ… Unified component architecture
- ðŸ”„ Styleguide expansion and component refinement

## Development Workflow

1. **Check styleguide first**: `/styleguide` for component patterns
2. **Follow established patterns**: Use existing depth/surface/border utilities
3. **Test all states**: hover, focus, active, disabled
4. **Verify visually**: Compare against styleguide examples

## Quality Gates

- **QA Testing Required**: No functional commits until user QA verification
- **Visual Consistency**: Match styleguide examples exactly
- **Component Standards**: CSS Modules + BEM, neumorphic shadows
- **Testing**: All new components need state demonstrations

## Key References

- **Design System**: `/styleguide` for visual patterns
- **Component Docs**: `docs/components/` for individual component specs
- **Development Rules**: `rules.md` for coding standards
- **Styleguide Guidelines**: `styleguide/claude.md` for UI maintenance

## Think Triggers

Use "think" or "think hard" for complex architectural decisions. Use "ultrathink" for major refactoring or design system changes.

## Documentation Maintenance

**Auto-update this file when:**

- New useful patterns emerge during development
- Workflow improvements are discovered
- Anti-patterns are identified and should be avoided
- Tool shortcuts or commands prove helpful

**Ask before updating when:**

- Major workflow changes are proposed
- Quality standards need modification
- Architecture decisions would affect project structure
